In embedded systems, object detection can be performed using an IR (Infrared) sensor, logic gates, and an Arduino Uno. The IR sensor emits infrared light, and when an object is detected (by reflecting the light), it sends a signal to the Arduino. Logic gates can be used to process the signal based on specific conditions (like distance or angle). The Arduino receives the processed signal and performs actions like triggering an alarm or controlling a motor. This setup is widely used in applications such as obstacle detection, automated doors, and robotics.
